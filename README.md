###Synopsis:

Ever walk out of work on a Friday night, look around and say to yourself "damn I really wish there was a super cool concert to go to right now that's within walking distance from where I am standing right now"?  Well this app aims to do just that.  We are working with the Bandsintown API and GoogleMaps API to create a site that will allow you to see what concerts are going on around you at any given moment.  You will be able to see where concerts are happening, what kind of music it is, what time the concert starts and how you can purchase tickets.
